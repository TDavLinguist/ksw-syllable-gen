S'gaw Karen Syllable Generator
===============================================================================

This is an lexd/hfst-based syllable generator for S'gaw Karen. 
It was created for the purpose of generating (theoretically) any possible syllable in S'gaw Karen (ISO 693-3: ksw). The included `makefile` can generate two types of files:

* ksw-syllables.ksw.txt - A text file containing all *legal* syllables in S'gaw Karen according to Kerbs (2025) and my own personal research
* ksw-syllables.ksw.unrestricted.txt - A text file containing any and all CVT combinations.

I primarily created this so that anyone working with S'gaw Karen in NLP would be able to use these syllables in a `twol` file to better define all possible syllable shapes, as some Unicode characters don't play nice with certain NLP tools.

On another level, a syllable list I previously used in my own project was created under a BSD license, which I thought was silly. Both syllable lists I include in this repo are hereby Public Domain, but if you generate your own syllable list, you can license it however you want, I guess. This software, however, is GPLv3, in line with its dependencies.

Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need the following software installed:

* lttoolbox (>= 3.5.1)

If this does not make any sense, we recommend you look at: apertium.org.
